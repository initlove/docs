1. introduction - mate-desktop.org 
   The MATE project was introduced by the video(slide) clearly.
   Part of its roadmap: support gtk3/wayland/systemd and remove useless fork.
2. en.opensuse.org/Portal:MATE
3. Core components and the core components in gnome2.
   mate = macro + cala + mate-session + mate-setting-daemon + mate-panel + others
   macro is the fork of metacity. metacity is dropped in gnome3.
   cala is the fork of nautlus. nautilus is still alive in gnome3.
   mate-session is not the fork of gnome-session, but the structure and codes are similiar.
        gnome-session is still alive in gnome3.
   mate-setting-daemon is the fork of gnome-setting-daemon. gnome-setting-daemon is still alive in gnome3.
   mate-panel is the fork of gnome-panel. gnome-panel is dropped in gnome3.
-----------------------------------

gnome2, gnome-fallback, gnome-flashback.

In some low resource machines or for the users who don't want to waste resources on rendering,
   gnome3 is not the choice.
(Users in favor of gnome2 user experience could use 'classic mode', that is another thing.)
Currently, we have gnome2-libs, gnome2-components, gnome3-libs, gnome3-components.

gnome2 : some of gnome2-libs and gnome2-components are no longer supported by upstream.
    (gnome-vfs2, metacity, gnome-panel ..)

gnome-fallback: removed because upstream don't want to maintain two desktops.

gnome-flashback is coming.
    https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-flashback-list/2013-April/msg00001.html
    It seems they plan to migrate gnome2-libs to gnome3-libs in gnome2-components,
    so at the end of the day, we will  have a gnome2 desktop and a gnome3 desktop sharing with one batch of libs.
    And they already make some works!
    It is same with MATE's roadmap.

-------------------------


xfce
1. The UI and the code base are different with gnome2/gnome3.
2. openSUSE:Factory. zypper in xfce
3. good community.
   40 submitters in xfce4-panel from 2013. It has more submitters than other xfce4-* components.
   I did not calculate the whole submitters, I guess in the whole xfce project, the number will be bigger.
4. written in c, depend on gtk2.
